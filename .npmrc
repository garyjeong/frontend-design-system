# Suppress npm warnings for unknown configs
# These warnings appear when npm is invoked (even when using pnpm)
# They don't affect functionality but can be suppressed here

# Set log level to suppress warnings (only show errors)

# Note: The warnings about unknown configs (npm-globalconfig, verify-deps-before-run,
# _jsr-registry, enable-pre-post-scripts) are from system/user-level npm configuration
# and don't affect the project functionality. This file helps suppress them.
